## Spidey-Sense
Smart Googles, an automated device to alert the blind that uses ultrasonic waves to detect an obstacle. The intensity of the buzzer increases as the distance decreases.

### Novelty of the Project
<p>This is a pair of wearable smart glasses for blind people that solves the majority of their problems. 
    According to WHO, 39 million people worldwide are estimated to be blind. They face numerous challenges in their daily lives. 
    The affected ones have been using the traditional white cane for many years which although being effective, still has a lot of disadvantages. 
    A pet animal, such as a dog, is another option, but it is very expensive. 
    As a result, the project's goal is to develop a less costly and more efficient method of assisting the visually impaired in navigating with greater comfort and      confidence.

### Future Enhancements
<p>The entire project can be built in the shape of a jacket, allowing us to detect obstacles from all sides. Using specially designed boards rather than Arduino and high-quality ultrasonic sensors can result in faster response, allowing the device to work efficiently in a crowd.
